# cs1-projects
This repository contains my Java projects from Computer Science 1 (CS1) during the 2019-2020 school year. CS1 was my first ever computer science class, in which I learned how to code for the first time. This was my first year learning Java. In this class, I learned the basics of programming, including print statements, variables, for/while loops, conditional statements, and how to build Java classes.

Course Description:

This is a beginnerâ€™s level approach to computer programming using the Java language. No previous knowledge of programming is necessary. Students will develop and apply algorithms to solve real-world problems. Programming concepts will be taught using structured programming techniques such as data types, program input/output, if statements, loops, arrays, and lists. Object-oriented programming will also be introduced. Other topics include debugging, hardware components, and social implications of computer systems. Upon completion of this course, the student will have created software programs using computer science programming concepts.
